This is a readem for Git ..


Steps to follow for commiting from local to repo 
git init (if you haven't initialized the repo yet)
git remote add origin <repo_url> (link the repo if not already done)
git add . (stage all changes)
git commit -m "message" (commit the changes)
git push origin main (push to the remote repo)


git branch 
git branch -m master main --> renaming the master to main 

git push -u origin main --force   --> use this the first time  if the git push -u origin main does not work 

Try to understand what it rebase that concept and merge conflicts and pull
