Python input and output 
name = arshad
print("thisis ",name)

amout = 100000
print("aMPOUT {:.2f}.format(amout)")

print("arhas",end=@)
print("gmail")   ---> o/p --> arhas@gmail

print("g","f","g", sep="") --> gfg
print("g","f","g", sep="-") -->g-f-g


print(f"mY NAME IS {name}")


Typecasting 

a = input("Enter")--> string
a= int(input("Enter"))--> it will be a intger and give only integer

float(input("Enter"))


Switch case :

Python has match and case instead of switch 
lang = input("What's the programming language you want to learn? ")

match lang:
    case "JavaScript":
        print("You can become a web developer.")

    case "Python":
        print("You can become a Data Scientist")

    case "PHP":
        print("You can become a backend developer")

    case "Solidity":
        print("You can become a Blockchain developer")

    case "Java":
        print("You can become a mobile app developer")
    case _:
        print("The language doesn't matter, what matters is solving problems.")




What is Stack Overflow in Recursion?

Whenever recursion calls are executed, theyâ€™re simultaneously stored in a recursion stack where they wait for the completion of the recursive function. 
A recursive function can only be completed if a base condition is fulfilled and the control returns to the parent function. 

But, when there is no base condition given for a particular recursive function, it gets called indefinitely which results in a Stack Overflow 
i.e, exceeding the memory limit of the recursion stack and hence the program terminates giving a Segmentation Fault error.
